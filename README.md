# Trivia-Game

Who doesn't love some good (probably somewhat useless) trivia?! 

Here's hoping y'all go to a brewery Trivia Night on Iceland and remember some of these questions.

To start the game, just click the handy Iceland Map and then choose your anwswer for each question! 
After you've chosen, the game will tell you if you were right or wrong and pull up the next question for you (it's defintely Javascript and jQuery, but who knows, it could be elves doing the magic).
You'll be able to see your report card at the very end of the game.

Here's a link to the game:
